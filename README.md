This is a web search-engine that can easily hold a few hundred million web-pages
in its search-index. If you want to see what it can do see

The above website runs on an Intel i7-3770K with 32gb RAM and two 500gb SSDs.


The software is written in Delphi (=Pascal). The code is written for Delphi XE2.
I don't know if it will compile and run in newer versions of Delphi.

Most - but not all - of the code will compile with FreePascal too.

Sorry for the quality of the code. Some of it was written 15 years ago when I was
still young and stupid. :)
