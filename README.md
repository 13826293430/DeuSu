# OpenAcoon

This is a web search-engine that can easily hold a few hundred million web-pages
in its search-index.

It is written in Delphi (=Pascal). The code is written for Delphi XE2. It don't know
if it will compile and run in newer versions. Most - but not all - of the code will
compile with FreePascal.

Sorry for the quality of the code. Some of it was written 15 years ago when I was
still young and stupid. :)
